## Why Go?

Go was created to address common problems faced in software development, especially at scale. Some reasons for its creation and widespread adoption:

> - Simplicity: Easy to learn, read, and write.
> - Performance: Compiles to machine code, offering near-C performance.
> - Concurrency: First-class support for concurrent programming with Goroutines.
> - Compilation Speed: Very fast build times, aiding rapid development.
> - Scalability: Ideal for large codebases, microservices, and cloud-native applications.
> - Cross-Platform: Compile once, run anywhere (Linux, Windows, macOS, etc.).
> - Open Source: Backed by Google and a vibrant open-source community.
