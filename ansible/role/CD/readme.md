## **Introduction**

This documentation outlines the Continuous Delivery (CD) workflow of Ansible roles, explaining how automation, testing, and delivery practices ensure consistent deployment of infrastructure code across environments.

---

## **What is Continuous Delivery in Ansible Roles?**

Continuous Delivery (CD) is a software development approach where code changes are automatically prepared for production release. For **Ansible roles**, CD ensures:

- Every update to a role is tested.
- Validated roles are versioned and published to repositories like Ansible Galaxy or internal artifact registries.
- Infrastructure code is consistently deployed with minimal manual intervention.

## **Workflow of Ansible Role CD**

| **Step**             | **Description**                                                                                 |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Role Creation**  | Develop modular and reusable Ansible roles with `tasks`, `handlers`, `vars`, `defaults`, etc.  |
| **2. Version Control**| Push the role to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).                                 |
| **3. CI Trigger**     | A push/merge triggers the pipeline via webhook or scheduled run.                               |
| **4. Linting & Syntax Check** | Tools like `ansible-lint` or `yamllint` check for best practices and syntax errors.   |
| **5. Unit Testing**   | Test using `molecule`, often with Docker or Vagrant to simulate environments.                  |
| **6. Integration Test**| Verify interaction with other roles or playbooks.                                              |
| **7. Role Versioning**| Update `meta/main.yml` and tag the release (`v1.0.0`).                                         |
| **8. Publishing**     | Automatically publish to Ansible Galaxy or internal registries.                                |
| **9. Deployment**     | Trigger playbooks using updated role versions on staging/production via tools like AWX/Tower.  |

## **CI/CD Tooling for Ansible Roles**

| **Tool**         | **Purpose**                                        |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **GitHub Actions** | Automate testing, linting, and publishing tasks. |
| **GitLab CI/CD**  | Integrated pipelines with extensive customization.|
| **Jenkins**       | Widely used for flexible CI/CD pipelines.         |
| **Molecule**      | Framework for testing Ansible roles.              |
| **Docker**        | Containerized test environments.                  |
| **Ansible Galaxy**| Role sharing and version control platform.        |

---

## **Best Practices**

- Modularize roles with clear responsibility.
- Maintain `README.md` and proper role metadata.
- Use idempotent tasks and avoid hardcoding.
- Automate testing with Molecule for all OS targets.
- Secure sensitive data using Ansible Vault.
- Maintain consistent tagging and changelog updates.
- Integrate secrets management (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).

---

## **Conclusion**

Implementing Continuous Delivery for Ansible roles ensures that infrastructure code is always in a deployable state. Automating tests, linting, and publishing minimizes errors and accelerates delivery across environments. This workflow aligns with modern DevOps practices, promoting scalable, secure, and maintainable infrastructure.
