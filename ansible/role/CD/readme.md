## **Introduction**

This document outlines the **Continuous Delivery (CD)** workflow for **Ansible roles**, detailing how tested and verified role updates can be automatically delivered to staging or production systems with minimal manual intervention. CD helps maintain infrastructure consistency and reliability through frequent, automated deployments.

## **What is Continuous Delivery in Ansible Roles?**

Continuous Delivery (CD) is the practice of automatically delivering validated infrastructure code—such as Ansible roles—to environments like staging or production. In the context of Ansible roles, CD ensures:

- Roles are automatically deployed after successful validation.
- Delivery pipelines push new versions of roles to designated environments.
- Minimal manual steps are required between development and production use.

## **CD Workflow for Ansible Roles**

| **Step**                 | **Description**                                                                                  |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Role Finalization** | Finalized, tested role including all necessary components (`tasks/`, `handlers/`, etc.).         |
| **2. Version Tagging**   | The role version is updated in `meta/main.yml` and a Git tag is created (e.g., `v1.2.0`).        |
| **3. Artifact Preparation** | The role is packaged if required for internal registries or external sharing.            |
| **4. Publishing**        | Role is uploaded to Ansible Galaxy or internal repositories.                                     |
| **5. Staging Delivery**  | Automation triggers deployment in a staging environment using the updated role.                  |
| **6. Validation in Staging** | Sanity or smoke tests validate the role’s impact in a near-prod environment.              |
| **7. Production Deployment** | Approved changes are automatically deployed to production environments.                |
| **8. Monitoring & Rollback** | Post-deployment monitoring and rollback options are maintained if issues arise.           |

## **CD Tools for Ansible Roles**

| **Tool**                | **Purpose in CD Workflow**                                      |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Ansible Tower / AWX** | Automate execution of playbooks using the latest role versions. |
| **Ansible Galaxy / Private Repo** | Host and version Ansible roles for delivery.           |
| **Git Tagging**         | Identify and mark specific role versions for release.           |
| **Webhook Triggers**    | Automate staging or production deployment when roles are updated.|
| **Approval Gates**      | Integrate manual or automated checks between staging and production. |
| **Monitoring Tools**    | Track role deployment health (e.g., Prometheus, ELK).            |

## **Best Practices**

- **Semantic Versioning**: Use semantic version tags (`v1.0.0`) for all production-ready role releases.
- **Immutable Roles**: Avoid editing previously published versions; treat roles as immutable artifacts.
- **Separate CD from CI**: Ensure CD processes trigger only after validation, not during development.
- **Approval Workflows**: Introduce gates between environments to prevent unintended production changes.
- **Rollback Strategy**: Maintain the ability to revert to a previously known good role version.
- **Environment Consistency**: Ensure staging and production mimic each other closely for realistic validation.

## **Conclusion**

Implementing **Continuous Delivery** for Ansible roles streamlines infrastructure changes and enhances system reliability. By automating role delivery and reducing human intervention, teams achieve faster, safer deployments and maintain consistent environments aligned with modern DevOps principles.
